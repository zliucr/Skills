# define this for ssh access
# ssh_tunnel:
#   host: <slurm host>
#   user: <username>
#   job_dir: <some location on slurm cluster to keep job metadata, uploaded code and generated sbatch files>
#   identity: <can specify ssh key to avoid entering password>


# if you're running directly from cluster, you only need to define job_dir and shouldn't use ssh_tunnel
# job_dir: <some location on slurm cluster to keep job metadata, uploaded code and generated sbatch files>


# define your account/partition here
# account: <slurm account>
# partition: <slurm partition>
# cpu_partition: <if cluster has a dedicated cpu partition, you can define it here>


# add required mounts for models/data here
# the code is mounted automatically inside /nemo_run/code
# but please note that we only package what's tracked by git + jsonl files inside nemo_skills/dataset

# mounts:
#   - <slurm location for your data/models>:<where to mount in a container>
#   e.g.
#   - <path on slurm>/models:/models
#   - <path on slurm>/data:/data
#   you can also override container libraries by directly mounting over them. E.g. to override NeMo-Aligner do
#   - <path on slurm>/NeMo-Aligner:/opt/NeMo-Aligner


# can use this section to set timeouts for different partitions
# this will be used as a slurm parameter + to signal SFT job to finish
# before the timeout to have time to save the last checkpoint
# default_timeout: "06:00:00"
# timeouts:
#   partition_name1: "06:00:00"
#   partition_name2: "01:30:00"

# define any environment variables. Note that HF_HOME is required by default and needs to be a mounted path!

  - HF_HOME=/lustre/fsw/portfolios/llmservice/users/dongfuj/.cache/huggingface
